## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.



### Navigation and Routing

- Flutter Navigator is just a stack with special methods like (future, futurebuilder, theme, etc).
- Screens/Routes are just widgets.
- Navigation from one route to another defines workflow of application.

### State Management

- Stateless/Statefull widgets.
- Flutter reflects its UI by reflecting current state.
- State is read while widget is built and can be changed using setState() for Stateful widgets.

### Object Oriented Approach

- Handling various functionalities by binding them in Class and creating Objects of them.
- Reusability of Code, Reducing Redundancy.

### Use of 3rd Party Packages

- Use of external packages provide application with variety of usefull functionalities.
- Make Application Standout.
